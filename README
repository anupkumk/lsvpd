lsvpd:
-----
The lsvpd package contains all of the lsvpd, lscfg and lsmcode commands.
These commands, along with a scanning program called vpdupdate, constitute
a hardware inventory system. The lsvpd command provides Vital Product Data
(VPD) about hardware components to higher-level serviceability tools. The
lscfg command provides a more human-readable format of the VPD, as well as
some system-specific information. lsmcode lists microcode and firmware
levels. lsvio lists virtual devices.

Compilation dependencies:
-------------------------
- C and C++ compiler (gcc, g++)
- GNU build tools (automake, autoconf, libtool, etc)
- librtas-devel
- libvpd-devel
- sg3_utils-devel
- zlib-devel

Binary dependencies:
--------------------
- iprutils
- librtas
- libvpd
- sg3_utils

Note:
  Package name may differ slightly between Linux distributors. Ex: RedHat and
  SLES ships development packages as "-devel" while Ubuntu ships it as "-dev"
  package. Please check your linux distribution package naming convention and
  make sure you have installed right packages.

Building:
---------
You can build on Power Linux System.

$ ./bootstrap.sh
$ ./configure [--prefix=/usr/]
$ make
$ make install

Building rpms:
--------------
To build a tarball to feed to rpmbuild, do

$ make dist-gzip

As an example, we use a command similar to the following:

$ rpmbuild -ba [--target=ppc/ppc64] <path-to-spec-file>

Hacking:
--------
All patches should be sent to the mailing list with linux-kernel style
'Signed-Off-By'. The following git commands are your friends:
- git commit -s
- git format-patch

You probably want to read the linux kernel Documentation/SubmittingPatches
as much of it applies to lsvpd.

Submitting patch:
-----------------
We use same mailing list for all Power Linux VPD and diagnostics projects
(ppc64-diag, libvpd, lsvpd, [lib]servicelog). It is common convention to
prefix your subject line with project name. This lets maintainer and other
developers more easily identify patches from patches targeted to other
projects. For example,

  Subject: [lsvpd PATCH 01/10] Summary phrase
